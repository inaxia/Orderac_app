## How does Orderac help?
Let's assume you entered a mall and found that it was fully crowded, you thought of having some food and went to the food court but you found a huge queue there. After waiting for a long while, you ordered some food and now you are waiting for your food but you have to go shopping also.

WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW?

Now, let's consider another situation...
This time you entered a crowded mall, took out your phone and opened the Orderac app, and ordered some food from the same crowded food court through the app, and boom!!
Now you can go shopping and can buy your favorite clothes, you can go and watch your favorite movie. And then, you get a notification that your food is ready, you go to the food court and take your order and can enjoy your meal happily.
